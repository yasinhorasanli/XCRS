Apart from coding along with the instructor:\n  - Try to build the same project at least 2 to 3 times on your own without looking at the video. If you get stuck, refer to the section of the video where the instructor builds that part of the project.\n  - Build something else that is similar to the project that you just built. For example, if you just built a todo app, try to build a notes app or a reminder app.\n\n## Project Ideas\n\nNow that you have learnt HTML and CSS, here are a few ideas for you to build:\n\n- Try to copy the design of a website that you like. \n  - Here is a [simple blog design in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/nh0V05z3NB87ue9v5PcO3R/writings.dev?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=2iQplaIojU3ydAfW-1) that you can try to copy.\n  - Or try to rebuild the [webpages of this website](https://cs.fyi/).\n- Take some inspiration from [personal portfolios of others](https://astro.build/showcase/) and build your own personal portfolio\n"

This file should contain a description of the project. Put some effort into the readme and make sure it clearly details what the project is about and how anyone can run it locally.\n- Add snapshots of your project to the readme file so that anyone can see what the project looks like without having to run it locally.\n- Add a `LICENSE` file to each repository that you create.

You can use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) to help you choose a license.\n\nYou can have a look at [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/kamranahmedse) and see how I have structured my repositories and how [some of my readme files look like](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/aws-cost-cli).\n"
