In the context of game physics, 'Force' is an influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical construction. It's typically implemented in game engines, with part of the physics simulation that computes forces like gravity, friction, or custom forces defined by the developer. Incorporating forces gives a realistic feel to the game, allowing objects to interact naturally following the laws of physics. This is central in genres like racing games, sports games, and any game featuring physical interactions between objects. Remember that `F = ma`, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to its mass. The balance and manipulation of these forces are integral to dynamic, immersive gameplay."

In simpler terms, it corresponds to how quickly an object moves around a circle or rotates around a central point. Angular velocity is typically measured in radians per second (rad/s). If you think of an object moving in a circular path, the angular velocity would be the speed at which the angle changes as the object travels along the circumference of the object. Angular velocity is a vector quantity, implying it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of the angular velocity vector is perpendicular to the plane of rotation, following the right-hand rule.

Buoyancy can be manipulated through adjustments in density and volume to create various effects - from making heavy objects float to sinking light ones.

The equation to compute friction is usually `f = μN`, where `f` is the force of friction, `μ` is the coefficient of friction (which depends on the two surfaces interacting), and `N` is the normal force (which is generally the weight of the object).

Unlike convex shapes, a straight line drawn within a concave shape may not entirely lie within the boundaries of the shape. Concave shapes add complexity in game physics, especially in collision detection, as there are more points and angles to consider compared to convex shapes. These shapes are commonly seen in game elements like terrains, mazes, game level boundaries and gaming characters.

When the ray strikes the surface, it will calculate the light’s color and angle to define how light should reflect off that surface. Reflection in shaders can further be classified into two types: Specular Reflection and Diffuse Reflection. Specular Reflection is the mirror-like reflection of light from a surface, where each incident ray is reflected with the light ray reflected at an equal but opposite angle. Diffuse Reflection, on the other hand, is the reflection of light into many directions, giving a softer effect. These reflections are quantified in computer graphics often using a reflection model such as the Phong reflection model or the Lambertian reflectance model."

They create depth and a sense of a three-dimensional space in a two-dimensional display. **Lighting** in game development mimics real-world light properties. It involves calculating how light interacts with different objects and surfaces based on their material characteristics and the light's intensity, direction, and color. Various algorithms, like Ray Tracing or Rasterization, are used to simulate these interactions. On the other hand, **shadows** are the areas unlit due to the blockage of light by an object. Producing realistic shadows involves complex computations, factoring in the light's position, the blocking object's shape and size, and the affected area's distance. Shadow Mapping and Shadow Volume are common techniques for creating shadows in game development. Special attention to these aspects can dramatically increase the perceived realism and immersion in the game environment."

A decision tree is a flowchart-like model, where each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of that test, and each leaf node holds a class label (decision made after testing all attributes). By applying decision tree learning models, computer-controlled characters can make decisions based on different conditions or states. They play a key role in creating complex and interactive gameplay experiences, by enabling game characters to adapt to the player's actions and the ever-changing game environment."
