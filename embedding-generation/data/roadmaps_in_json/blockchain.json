Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons.\n\nThis decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [Why Blockchain?](https://www.blockchain.education/blockchain101/blockchain)\n- [What Is The Blockchain And Why Does It Matter?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/05/18/what-is-the-blockchain-and-why-does-it-matter/)\n- [Web3/Crypto: Why Bother?](https://continuations.com/post/671863718643105792/web3crypto-why-bother)\n- [Why is Blockchain Important and Why Does it Matter](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/blockchain-tutorial/why-is-blockchain-important)\n"
