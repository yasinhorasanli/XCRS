It describes utilities, APIs, and services that a compliant OS should provide to software, thus making it easier to port programs from one system to another.\n\nA practical example: in a Unix-like operating system, there are three _standard streams_, `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` - they are I/O connections that you will probably come across when using a terminal, as they manage the flow from the **standard input** (stdin), **standard output** (stdout) and **standard error** (stderr).\n\nSo, in this case, when we want to interact with any of these streams (through a process, for example), the POSIX operating system API makes it easier - for example, in the `<unistd.h>` C header where the stdin, stderr, and stdout are defined as `STDIN_FILENO`, `STDERR_FILENO` and `STDOUT_FILENO`.\n\nPOSIX also adds a standard for exit codes, filesystem semantics, and several other command line utility API conventions.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [POSIX standard by IEEE](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)\n- [Summary of some POSIX implementations](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/220877)\n- [A guide to POSIX](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/posix)\n"

For example, Microsoft SQL Server has the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and the sys.dm_os_wait_stats dynamic management view, while Oracle has the Oracle Enterprise Manager and the v$waitstat view. These tools allow you to see specific performance metrics, such as the amount of time spent waiting on locks or the number of physical reads and writes.\n- Use third-party tools: There are also several third-party tools that can help you profile the performance of a database. Some examples include SolarWinds Database Performance Analyzer, Quest Software Foglight, and Redgate SQL Monitor. These tools often provide more in-depth performance analysis and can help you identify specific issues or bottlenecks.\n- Analyze slow queries: If you have specific queries that are running slowly, you can use tools like EXPLAIN PLAN or SHOW PLAN in MySQL or SQL Server to see the execution plan for the query and identify any potential issues. You can also use tools like the MySQL slow query log or the SQL Server Profiler to capture slow queries and analyze them further.\n- Monitor application performance: If you are experiencing performance issues with a specific application that is using the database, you can use tools like Application Insights or New Relic to monitor the performance of the application and identify any issues that may be related to the database.\n\nHave a look at the documentation for the database that you are using.\n"

It is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, particularly between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). In a SAML-based system, a user requests access to a protected resource. The service provider asks the identity provider to authenticate the user and assert whether they are granted access to the resource.\n\n### Benefits of SAML\n\nSome advantages of using SAML include:\n\n- Single Sign-On (SSO): Users can log in once at the IdP and access multiple service providers without needing to authenticate again.\n- Improved security: Passwords and user credentials are not required to be stored and managed by the service provider, reducing the potential vectors for attack.\n- Increased efficiency: As users no longer need to maintain multiple sets of credentials, managing access becomes easier for both the user and the system administrators.\n- Interoperability: SAML enables a wide range of applications to work together, regardless of the underlying technology or platform.\n\n### SAML Components\n\nThree main components are involved in the SAML architecture:\n\n1. **Identity Provider (IdP)**: The entity that manages users' identities and authenticates them by providing security tokens, also called assertions.\n2. **Service Provider (SP)**: The entity that provides a service (such as a web application or API) and relies on the identity provider to authenticate users and grant/deny access to the resources.\n3. **User/Principal**: The end user seeking access to the service provided by the service provider.\n\n### SAML Workflow\n\nThe SAML authentication process consists of the following steps:\n\n1. The user requests access to a protected resource from the service provider.\n2. If the user is not already authenticated, the service provider generates and sends a SAML authentication request to the identity provider.\n3. The identity provider authenticates the user (using, e.g., a username and password, multi-factor authentication, or another method).\n4. The identity provider constructs a SAML response, which includes details about the user and asserts whether the user is authorized to access the requested resource.\n5. The SAML response is sent back to the service provider, typically via the user's web browser or API client.\n6. The service provider processes the SAML response, extracts the necessary information, and grants or denies access to the user based on the identity provider's assertion.\n\nWith SAML, you can streamline user authentication and authorization across various applications and systems, providing a better user experience and improving your overall backend security.\n"

Memcached is free and open-source software, licensed under the Revised BSD license. Memcached runs on Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS) and on Microsoft Windows. It depends on the `libevent` library.\n\nMemcached's APIs provide a very large hash table distributed across multiple machines. When the table is full, subsequent inserts cause older data to be purged in the least recently used (LRU) order. Applications using Memcached typically layer requests and additions into RAM before falling back on a slower backing store, such as a database.\n\nMemcached has no internal mechanism to track misses which may happen.

Here are some of the topics off the top of my head:\n\n- Use a firewall: One of the most effective ways to secure a server is to use a firewall to block all unnecessary incoming traffic. You can use iptables on Linux systems or a hardware firewall to do this.\n- Close unnecessary ports: Make sure to close any ports that are not needed for your server to function properly. This will reduce the attack surface of your server and make it more difficult for attackers to gain access.\n- Use strong passwords: Use long, complex passwords for all of your accounts, and consider using a password manager to store them securely.\n- Keep your system up to date: Make sure to keep your operating system and software up to date with the latest security patches. This will help to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by attackers.\n- Use SSL/TLS for communication: Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between your server and client devices. This will help to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and other types of cyber threats.\n- Use a intrusion detection system (IDS): An IDS monitors network traffic and alerts you to any suspicious activity, which can help you to identify and respond to potential threats in a timely manner.\n- Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of authentication, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.\n\nAlso learn about OpenSSL and creating your own PKI as well as managing certs, renewals, and mutual client auth with x509 certs\n"

These principles will ensure that the backend is efficient, scalable, and maintainable.\n\n## 1. Separation of Concerns (SoC)\n\nSeparation of Concerns is a fundamental principle that states that different functionalities of a system should be as independent as possible. This approach improves maintainability and scalability by allowing developers to work on separate components without affecting each other. Divide your backend into clear modules and layers, such as data storage, business logic, and network communication.\n\n## 2. Reusability\n\nReusability is the ability to use components, functions, or modules in multiple places without duplicating code. While designing the backend, look for opportunities where you can reuse existing code. Use techniques like creating utility functions, abstract classes, and interfaces to promote reusability and reduce redundancy.\n\n## 3. Keep It Simple and Stupid (KISS)\n\nKISS principle states that the simpler the system, the easier it is to understand, maintain, and extend. When designing the backend, try to keep the architecture and code as simple as possible. Use clear naming conventions and modular structures, and avoid over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.\n\n## 4. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)\n\nDo not duplicate code or functionality across your backend. Duplication can lead to inconsistency and maintainability issues. Instead, focus on creating reusable components, functions or modules, which can be shared across different parts of the backend.\n\n## 5. Scalability\n\nA scalable system is one that can efficiently handle an increasing number of users, requests, or data. Design the backend with scalability in mind, considering factors such as data storage, caching, load balancing, and horizontal scaling (adding more instances of the backend server).\n\n## 6. Security\n\nSecurity is a major concern when developing any application. Always follow best practices to prevent security flaws, such as protecting sensitive data, using secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, and sanitizing user inputs.\n\n## 7. Testing\n\nTesting is crucial for ensuring the reliability and stability of the backend. Implement a comprehensive testing strategy, including unit, integration, and performance tests. Use automated testing tools and set up continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines to streamline the testing and deployment process.\n\n## 8. Documentation\n\nProper documentation helps developers understand and maintain the backend codebase. Write clear and concise documentation for your code, explaining the purpose, functionality, and how to use it. Additionally, use comments and appropriate naming conventions to make the code itself more readable and self-explanatory.\n\nBy following these design and development principles, you'll be well on your way to creating an efficient, secure, and maintainable backend for your applications.\n"

They store and retrieve data based on unique indexes, which allow for fast and accurate searches. As a backend developer, understanding search engines functionalities, and how to integrate them into your web application, is crucial.\n\n## Types of Search Engines\n\nThere are two primary types of search engines: \n\n1. **Full-text search engines**: These are specifically designed for searching and analyzing text documents. They can efficiently index large volumes of text and provide relevant results based on keywords or phrases. Popular full-text search engines examples include **Elasticsearch**, **Solr**, and **Amazon CloudSearch**.\n\n2. **Database search engines**: Database engines are built-in features of most databases. They provide search capabilities within the data stored in the database. Examples include **MySQL FULLTEXT search** and **PostgreSQL Full-Text Search**.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\nWhen dealing with search engines, it's important to understand these key concepts:\n\n- **Indexing**: The process of analyzing and storing data in an optimized format for fast search and retrieval.\n- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or terms (also known as tokens), for efficient indexing and searching.\n- **Querying**: The act of searching the indexed data by asking a specific question or requesting information based on keywords or phrases.\n- **Relevance scoring**: A score assigned to each search result that indicates how closely it matches the query, based on algorithms and relevance models.\n\n## Integration\n\nTo integrate a search engine into your web application, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose the search engine**: Identify the search engine that best suits your application's needs, considering factors such as scalability, performance, and ease of integration.\n2. **Index your data**: Analyze and store your data using the chosen search engine. This process may involve creating an index, specifying fields, and defining how the data should be tokenized and analyzed.\n3. **Implement search functionality**: Develop the backend code for handling search requests, such as sending queries to the search engine and parsing the responses. Additionally, make sure to handle user inputs, like keywords, phrases, and filters.\n4. **Display search results**: Design the frontend of your application to show search results in a user-friendly manner, including pagination, sorting, and filters.\n"

A web server establishes a connection to the Internet and facilitates the physical data exchange with other web-connected devices.\n\n### Software side:\n\nA software web server has a number of software components that regulate how hosted files are accessed by online users. This is at the very least an HTTP server. Software that knows and understands HTTP and URLs (web addresses) is known as an HTTP server (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). The content of these hosted websites is sent to the end user's device through an HTTP server, which may be accessed via the domain names of the websites it holds.\n\nBasically, an HTTP request is made by a browser anytime it wants a file that is stored on a web server. The relevant (hardware) web server receives the request, which is then accepted by the appropriate (software) HTTP server, which then locates the requested content and returns it to the browser over HTTP. (If the server cannot locate the requested page, it responds with a 404 error.)\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [What is a Web Server ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server)\n- [Web Server Concepts and Examples](https://youtu.be/9J1nJOivdyw)\n"

It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.\n\nTo use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events.

It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to balance the workload of a system and to optimize the use of resources.\n\nThere are several ways to implement load shifting in a cloud environment:\n\n- Scheduling: This involves scheduling the execution of tasks or workloads to occur at specific times or intervals.\n- Load balancing: This involves distributing the workload of a system across multiple resources, such as servers or containers, to ensure that the workload is balanced and that resources are used efficiently.\n- Auto-scaling: This involves automatically adjusting the number of resources that are available to a system based on the workload, allowing the system to scale up or down as needed.\n\nLoad shifting is an important aspect of cloud design, as it helps to ensure that resources are used efficiently and that the system remains stable and available. It is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as throttling and backpressure, to provide a scalable and resilient cloud environment.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [Load Shifting - AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/serverless/patterns/load-shifting/)\n"

It is commonly used in cloud computing environments to prevent cascading failures and to improve the resilience and availability of a system.\n\nA circuit breaker consists of three states: closed, open, and half-open. In the closed state, the circuit breaker allows operations to proceed as normal. If the system encounters a failure or becomes overloaded, the circuit breaker moves to the open state, and all subsequent operations are immediately stopped. After a specified period of time, the circuit breaker moves to the half-open state, and a small number of operations are allowed to proceed. If these operations are successful, the circuit breaker moves back to the closed state; if they fail, the circuit breaker moves back to the open state.\n\nThe circuit breaker design pattern is useful for protecting a system from failures or excessive load by providing a way to temporarily stop certain operations and allow the system to recover. It is often used in conjunction with other design patterns, such as retries and fallbacks, to provide a more robust and resilient cloud environment.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [Circuit Breaker - AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_mitigate_interaction_failure_graceful_degradation.html)\n"

These include the HTTP server, middleware, database, third-party API services, and more.\n\nTelemetry is the process of continuously collecting data from different components of the application. This data helps engineering teams to troubleshoot issues across services and identify the root causes.
