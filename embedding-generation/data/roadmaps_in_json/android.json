Tools like XML and Material Designs are used for interface design in Android. Meanwhile, \"Navigation\" refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within the app, following a clear path, like a map. Android uses the Navigation Component, a suite of libraries, tools, and guidance on constructing in-app navigation. Understanding both these elements, Interface and Navigation, is fundamental to creating an intuitive and user-friendly Android application."

The instance of the class is usually created by a method, referred to as a `factory method`, which is either specified in an interface and implemented in implementing classes or implemented in a base class which may be optionally overridden by derived classes. The Factory Method is used when we want to provide users with a way to create an instance of a class from one of several possible classes that share a common super class.\n\nHere is a basic example of the Factory Pattern:\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Animal {\n    public abstract String makeSound();\n}\n\npublic class Dog extends Animal {\n    @override\n    public String makeSound() {\n        return \"Woof\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Cat extends Animal {\n    @override\n    public String makeSound() {\n        return \"Meow\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class AnimalFactory {\n    public Animal createAnimal(String type) {\n        if (\"Dog\".equals(type)) {\n            return new Dog();\n        } else if (\"Cat\".equals(type)) {\n            return new Cat();\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the code above, `AnimalFactory` is the factory class responsible to create and return instances of `Dog` and `Cat` classes."

This pattern introduces a unidirectional data flow which makes it easier to understand an app's state at any given point in time. In the MVI pattern, the `Intent` represents an intention or desire to perform an action, often triggered by user inputs. The `View` is responsible for rendering the UI and emitting intents. The `Model`, on the other hand, represents the state of the app and reacts to intents by changing its state. It's the Model's responsibility to respond to each Intent with a resulting new state. Once a new state is created, it is published back to the `View`. This clear separation and single direction of data and event flow can help in managing side-effects and handling asynchronous actions."
