In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).\n\nFlutter consists of two important parts:\n\n- An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).\n- A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.\n  To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.\n\nDart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.\n\nIf you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:\n\n- [Visit Dedicated Flutter Roadmap](/flutter)\n- [Flutter Website](https://flutter.dev)\n- [Flutter Tutorial](https://www.w3adda.com/flutter-tutorial)\n- [Flutter Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ukSR1GRtMU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ)\n- [Flutter Tutorial](https://www.w3adda.com/flutter-tutorial)\n- [Learn Dart Programming](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dart_programming/index.htm)\n- [12 Ways Flutter Streamlines App Development](https://thenewstack.io/12-ways-flutter-streamlines-app-development/)\n"

The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.\n- **[IDLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IDL)** - Not every developer will have a need for understanding [IDLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IDL) but there's a good argument for having more JavaScript developers aware of their existence and hopefully the ability for making use of them as well.\n- **[WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)** - WebAssembly is a comparatively new technology that allows you to run code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web. It's a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++ and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.\n"
