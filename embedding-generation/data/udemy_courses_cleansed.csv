With a focus on natural language understanding and interactive dialogue management, Rasa enables the creation of intelligent and personalized conversational experiences.
At its core, Rasa consists of two main components: Rasa NLU and Rasa Core. Rasa NLU handles the understanding of user inputs by extracting intent and entities from text, allowing the chatbot to comprehend user requests accurately. This facilitates effective communication by translating user messages into structured data that the bot can process.
On the other hand, Rasa Core takes care of dialogue management, enabling the bot to handle dynamic and interactive conversations. It employs machine learning techniques to predict the next best actions based on the conversation's context, ensuring a seamless and contextually relevant interaction flow.
